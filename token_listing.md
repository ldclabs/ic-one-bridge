# Apply for Token Listing

One Bridge is a cross-chain token bridge project based on a "lock/release" mechanism, running entirely on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.

Each token asset is managed by a dedicated ICP smart contract (canister). This canister already enables seamless multi-chain token transfers between ICP, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and other EVM-compatible networks, with future support planned for Solana and more blockchain networks.

## Application Requirements

1. The project team must deploy the One Bridge canister on ICP and the corresponding token contracts on each target chain (e.g., an ERC-20 contract for EVM-compatible chains).
2. The contract code must be an official stable release, and the ERC-20 contract must have its source code verified.
3. The controllers of the One Bridge canister and the Token Ledger canister on ICP must be an SNS DAO, the NNS, or a black hole address to ensure the contract's security and decentralization.
4. The project team must provide sufficient liquidity to support cross-chain transfers.
5. The project team is responsible for covering the transaction fees (Gas Fees) on all respective chains.

## Application Process

1. The project team completes the deployment and configuration of the smart contracts.
2. Submit the token information and contract addresses via a Github issue or on X (@ICPandaDAO) for review by our team (the ICPanda Team).
3. Upon approval, the project team must provide sufficient liquidity and funds for gas fees.
4. We will submit a proposal to add the token to the official One Bridge list for public review and voting.
5. Once the proposal is passed, the token will be automatically listed on the One Bridge cross-chain bridge.
